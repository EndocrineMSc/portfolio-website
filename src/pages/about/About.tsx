      <p>
        Hello! My name is Sebastian, and I am a biologist (MSc) transitioning
        into the field of web development. My professional background is in
        diagnostics development, where I developed a strong analytical skill set
        and attention to detail. Recently, I&apos;ve decided to pivot my career
        toward web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this, I embarked on a self-taught journey through The Odin
        Project, an open-source curriculum for full-stack development. This
        program has provided me with a solid understanding of web technologies
        such as React, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently building a full-stack project (rpg-adventure-journal)
        that demonstrates my ability to create dynamic web applications. This
        project is an essential part of my portfolio and reflects my technical
        capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I have also explored game development prior to web
        development. I taught myself C# programming for Unity and developed a
        game prototype, implementing a substantial amount of object-oriented
        code. This experience has broadened my technical skills and allowed me
        to apply my programming knowledge creatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am now looking to apply my diverse background and technical skills in
        web development. I am keen to contribute to innovative projects and
        continue learning in this dynamic field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to
        potential opportunities in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best regards, <br />
        Sebastian Schulz
