    "p1": "Hello! My name is Sebastian, and I am a biologist (MSc) transitioning into the field of web development. My professional background is in diagnostics development, where I developed a strong analytical skill set and attention to detail. Recently, I've decided to pivot my career toward web development.",
    "p2": "To achieve this, I embarked on a self-taught journey through The Odin Project, an open-source curriculum for full-stack development. This program has provided me with a solid understanding of web technologies such as React, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js.",
    "p3": "I am currently in the process of building a full-stack project (rpg-adventure-journal) that demonstrates my ability to create dynamic web applications. This project will be an essential part of my portfolio and reflects my technical capabilities.",
    "p4": "In addition, I have also explored game development prior to web development. I taught myself C# programming for Unity and developed a game prototype, implementing a substantial amount of object-oriented code. This experience has broadened my technical skills and allowed me to apply my programming knowledge creatively.",
    "p5": "I am now looking to apply my diverse background and technical skills in web development. I am keen to contribute to interesting projects and continue learning in this dynamic field.",
    "p6": "Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to potential opportunities in web development.",
    "signage": "Best regards,"
